# Data Flow

Zoryu follows a linear, state-driven data flow designed to move from information to measurable outcomes.

## Market → Signal → Position → Metrics

1. Market data is ingested and normalized by the backend
2. AI processes market context and generates structured signals
3. Signals become tracked positions with defined parameters
4. Live prices are compared against TP and SL thresholds
5. Position outcomes are recorded and aggregated into metrics

This flow ensures that every signal is accountable to an observed result.

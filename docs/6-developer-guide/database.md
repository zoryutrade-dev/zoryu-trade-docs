# Database

Zoryu uses a relational database for system state persistence.

## Stored Data

- AI-generated signals
- tracked positions and lifecycle states
- performance metrics and history

## Not Stored

- private keys
- wallet secrets
- signing material

The database exists to support tracking, evaluation, and transparency, not custody.

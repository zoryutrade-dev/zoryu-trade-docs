# Dashboard

The Dashboard provides a consolidated view of system state and performance.

## Purpose

- display aggregate performance metrics
- provide situational awareness
- enable navigation across modules

## Displayed Data

The dashboard reflects backend-authoritative data and does not infer state client-side.

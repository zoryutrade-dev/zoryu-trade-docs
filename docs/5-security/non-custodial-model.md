# Non-Custodial Security Model

Zoryu Trade is built with a strict non-custodial architecture. The platform never takes ownership or control of user assets.

## What Zoryu Does Not Do

- store private keys
- sign transactions server-side
- manage internal balances
- custody user funds
- settle trades off-chain

All transactions are signed directly by the user’s wallet and settled on-chain.

## Zoryu’s Role

Zoryu functions as:
- a coordination layer for execution
- an intelligence layer for trade analysis
- a state-tracking layer for performance evaluation

Asset control always remains with the user.

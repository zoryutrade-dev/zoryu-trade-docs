# Long-Term Direction

Zoryu’s long-term goal is to function as a general-purpose trading infrastructure rather than a single-use application.

## Direction

- readiness for orderbook-based trading environments
- support for more advanced execution logic
- modular intelligence layers for different strategies
- infrastructure abstractions for professional trading workflows

At every stage, Zoryu maintains its core principles: non-custodial operation, execution transparency, and measurable outcomes.

# Overview — What is Zoryu Trade

Zoryu Trade is a non-custodial trading terminal built for Solana markets, designed to unify **real-time market data**, **AI-assisted trade intelligence**, and **on-chain execution** into a single, coherent workflow.

Zoryu is not an exchange and does not custody user funds. It never stores private keys, never signs transactions server-side, and does not operate off-chain balances. All trades are executed through user-connected wallets with on-chain settlement as the source of truth.

Unlike conventional tools that stop at visualization or broadcast untracked signals, Zoryu is built as a **state-aware trading system**. Signals are generated as structured trade objects (entry, TP, SL, risk) and tracked through a lifecycle, allowing measurable outcomes such as PnL and win rate to be derived from observed price movement rather than narrative claims.

Zoryu’s goal is to reduce workflow fragmentation while preserving control: traders keep custody, while the system provides clarity, execution transparency, and performance accountability.

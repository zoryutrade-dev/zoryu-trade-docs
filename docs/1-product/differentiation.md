# What Makes Zoryu Different

Zoryu Trade is differentiated not by surface-level features, but by how its components are connected.

## Execution-Aware Design

Most tools focus on charts or signals in isolation. Zoryu is built with execution in mind from the start, ensuring that signals map directly to executable trade parameters.

## Signals as System State

Signals are treated as structured data with lifecycle states rather than static messages. This enables consistent tracking, evaluation, and comparison.

## Backend-Authoritative Tracking

Position state and metrics are managed by the backend, not inferred by the frontend. This avoids inconsistencies and enables reliable performance analysis.

## Transparency Over Abstraction

Zoryu avoids opaque automation. Trade parameters, execution results, and metrics are explicit and verifiable.

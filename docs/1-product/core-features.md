# Core Features

Zoryu Trade is built around a set of tightly integrated features that form a complete trading workflow rather than isolated tools.

## Trading Terminal

The Trading Terminal combines market visibility and execution into a single interface.

Key capabilities:
- real-time price and volume monitoring
- interactive charts for technical context
- buy and sell execution with explicit slippage settings
- wallet-based balance visibility

The terminal is designed to reduce friction between analysis and execution while preserving non-custodial control.

## AI Signal Engine

The AI Signal Engine generates structured trading signals based on market context.

Each signal provides:
- direction (long/short)
- entry price
- multiple take-profit targets
- stop-loss threshold
- confidence score and risk-to-reward ratio
- reasoning context

Signals are designed for execution and tracking, not passive consumption.

## Position Tracking & Metrics

Signals automatically become tracked positions.

The system monitors:
- position status transitions
- real-time price comparison
- PnL calculation
- historical performance metrics

This enables objective evaluation of strategies over time.

## Non-Custodial Execution

Zoryu does not custody funds or sign transactions.

All trades are executed through user wallets and settled on-chain, ensuring transparency and user control.
